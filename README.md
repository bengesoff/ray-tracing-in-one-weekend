# Ray Tracing In One Weekend

My implementation of the [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.
Written in basic Rust as an exercise.
Outputs a PPM-encoded image to stdout.

To run:

```bash
cargo run > image.ppm
```

Then on MacOS:

```bash
open image.ppm
```
